# Customer Segmentation Using AutoEncoder and Unsupervised Learning

This project is an example of customer segmentation using an AutoEncoder for dimensionality reduction and unsupervised machine learning k-means algorithm for clustering. The aim is to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior, in order to better understand their needs and preferences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Approach

The project uses an AutoEncoder implemented in TensorFlow to perform dimension reduction on the customer data. Then, K-Means clustering is used to segment the customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. Finally, cluster analysis is conducted to understand the characteristics of each customer group.
